<h4><a id="10-additional-functions-of-the-game" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>10.Additional Functions of the Game</h4>
<p>10.1. This Section of the Agreement regulates the procedure and conditions of the Licensor granting the Licensee the Right to Access the Additional Functions of the Game.</p>
<p>10.2. Upon the Licensee’s request, the Licensor shall provide the Licensee with a paid service that involves the digital exchange of money for Virtual Currency to Use the Additional, Expanded, and Special Functions of the Game (including character attributes, privileges, special in-Game objects, gifts, etc.). For instance, as a result of using such Functions, the character controlled by the Licensee may receive various in-Game valuables, which, among other benefits, may allow the character to progress through the Game faster. The in-Game valuables are non-material and may only be used by the Licensee while playing the Game. The above service shall be regarded as rendered in full after the money is converted into the Virtual Currency. For the avoidance of any doubts, purchases of Virtual Currency &quot;Gold&quot; in our games are non-refundable. We do not provide a refund.</p>
<p>The Right to Use the Additional Functions of the Game shall be granted to the Licensee under a basic non-exclusive license for a given fee and within the limits provided for herein, based on the amount of Virtual Currency that the Licensee has received by using the paid service that involves the exchange of money for Virtual Currency. The service that involves the exchange of money for Virtual Currency shall be paid for by the Licensee in the official currency of the relevant territory, in the amount equaling the total cost of the Virtual Currency to Use the Additional Functions of the Game that the Licensee has selected. The cost of one Virtual Currency to Use the Additional Functions of the Game is listed on the special web page for adding funds to the Licensee’s personal profile in our game. This cost may be changed by the Licensor unilaterally and at any time without prior notice to the Licensee. The cost of the previously used service that involves the exchange of money for Virtual Currency to Use the Additional Functions of the Game shall not be reviewed.</p>
<p>The Licensor may use the Additional Functions of the Game by freely exchanging the Virtual Currency that they have purchased for any in-Game valuables that are part of the Additional Functions of the Game, at an exchange rate that is defined by the Game Rules and by the process of playing the Game. The Licensee may then use the in-Game valuables thus received on an equal basis with any other in-Game valuables that the Licensee may have obtained while playing the Game in compliance with the Game Rules. The Licensor shall not be held liable if the Licensee’s character loses the aforementioned in-Game valuables as a result of in-Game events (theft, destruction, depletion etc.) if such events fall within the Game Rules.</p>
<p>The Licensee hereby acknowledges that their character’s access to the Additional Functions of the Game, measured by Virtual Currency, may be withdrawn in accordance herewith (for instance, if all the Additional Functions have been consumed or stolen by another character, if the Licensee’s access to the Game has been suspended/blocked, etc.) or for any other reason, and that this shall not give the Licensee the right to demand that the Licensor refund the license fee that the Licensee paid in exchange for accessing such Additional Functions of the Game.</p>
<p>10.3. The Right to Use the Additional Functions of the Game shall be deemed granted to the Licensee the moment the respective amount of Virtual Currency is transferred to the Licensee’s personal in-Game profile.</p>
<p>The Licensee’s Right to Use the Additional Functions of the Game shall be valid for as long as this Agreement is valid, unless the amount of Virtual Currency received by the Licensee depletes sooner.</p>
<p>10.4. When the Licensee registers in the Game, the Licensor shall automatically assign them a personal in-Game profile, which is directly linked to their account.</p>
<p>10.5. The methods and conditions of using various payment systems to exchange money for the Virtual Currency to Use the Additional Functions of the Game shall be shared by the Licensor. The Licensee shall pay the license fee by transferring the relevant amount of money to the Licensor’s settlement account through one of the supported payment systems. The list of available payment systems shall be published on the Licensor’s Website. All the main provisions hereof on the payment methods and conditions shall also be applicable to a Game Subscription (if available).</p>
<p>10.6. When paying for the service that involves the exchange of money for the Virtual Currency to Use the Additional Functions of the Game, the Licensee shall undertake to follow all the instructions on the payment methods and procedures, specifically the instructions on entering the symbols and digits received via text message (SMS), including the capitalization sequence, the number sequence, and the input language. The Licensee shall receive the Right to Use the Additional Functions of the Game only if they follow the relevant instructions and payment conditions. The Licensor shall not be held liable for the Licensee following the payment instructions incorrectly. Should be Licensee have any questions regarding the rules and procedures of using payment systems to transfer money to the Licensor’s settlement account, the Licensee must consult the companies that operate these payment systems. The Licensor shall not give the Licensee any comments on issues arising out of the rules and procedures of using payment systems; nor shall the Licensor compensate the Licensee for any money that the Licensee transferred through a payment system in order to use the service that involves the exchange of money for the Virtual Currency to Use the Additional Functions of the Game, if this transfer has been made in violation of the rules put in place by the payment system, which, in turn, has resulted in the Licensor’s failure to receive the payment.</p>
<p>10.7. The Licensee shall be granted the Right to Use the Additional Functions of the Game only if they pay for such Rights in full in compliance herewith. Furthermore, the Licensor reserves the right not to grant such Rights to the Licensee, or to grant them only in part, until the Licensor receives a confirmation that these Rights have been paid for.</p>
<p>10.8. Should the Licensee gain access to the Additional Functions of the Game without being granted the Right to Use such Functions in a manner defined herein, as a result of either a technical error or a Game malfunction or premeditated action on the part of the Licensee, the Licensee shall undertake to inform the Licensor of this occurrence and either compensate the Licensor for the Right to Use the aforementioned Additional Functions, or eliminate any and all consequences of their unauthorized use of the Additional Functions. The Licensor also has the right to eliminate such consequences independently, without notifying the Licensee (by removing the in-game valuables, decreasing the character’s level, etc.).</p>
<p>10.9.

<p>10.13. The use of the service that involves exchanging money for the Virtual Currency to Use the Additional Functions of the Game shall not free the Licensee from the obligation to follow this Agreement and the Game Rules; nor shall it make the Licensee exempt from any measures provided for in this Agreement or in the Game Rules, including full or partial restriction of access to the Game and its Additional Functions. In such cases, the cost of the service that involves the exchange of money for Virtual Currency to Use the Additional Functions of the Game shall not be refunded to the Licensee.</p>
<p>10.14. The Licensee shall guarantee to the Licensor that they have been authorized to use the selected payment method for purchasing the Additional Functions of the Game, and that their use of this payment method does not violate the laws of HongKong and/or the laws of any other country that the Licensee is citizen of, or the rights of third parties.
